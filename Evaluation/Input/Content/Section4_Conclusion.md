The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of itraconazole in adults.

In particular, the model includes the subsequent metabolites hydroxy-itraconazole, keto-itraconazola and N-desalkyl-itraconazole -  all of them formed by CYP3A4. The model applies competitive inhibition of CYP3A4 itraconzaole and the three metabolites. Thus, the model is fit for purpose to be applied for the investigation of drug-drug interactions with regard to strong CYP3A4 inhibition.
