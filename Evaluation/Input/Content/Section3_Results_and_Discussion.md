The PBPK model for itraconazole was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was built and evaluated covering data from various clinical studies, covering a dosing range of 100 to 200 mg in different formulations (solution *vs.* capsule), administered under fasting conditions or together with food.

The model quantifies metabolism via CYP3A4 and inhibition of CYP3A4.

The next sections show:

1. the final model input parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#31-Final-Input-Parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#32-Diagnostics-Plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#33-Concentration-Time-Profiles).
