### 2.3.1 Absorption

Clinical data suggest that the bioavailability of itraconazole is enhanced when an oral solution is given in the fasted state compared to fed state ([Van de Welde 1996](#5-Reference), [Barone 1998a](#5-Reference)). In contradiction, a meal significantly enhances the amount of itraconazole absorbed after administrations of capsules (in comparison to fasted state administrations of capsules) ([Barone 1993a](#5-Reference)). Thus, four different scenarios can be identified:  *solution fasted*, *solution fed*, *capsule fasted* and *capsule fed*. The *solution fasted* scenario was considered to be the reference scenario.

Herein, the model parameter `Specific intestinal permeability` was optimized to best match clinical data (see  [Section 2.3.5](#2.3.5-Automated-Parameter-Identification)). The default solubility was assumed to be the measured value in the FaSSIF medium (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)).

In a next step, the solubility was optimized for the *solution fed* scenario (in comparison to *solution fasted*).

Then, for the scenarios *capsule fasted* and *capsule fed*, solubility and the dissolution of the capsules (implemented via an empirical Weibull dissolution) were optimized. 

The results of the optimization can be found in [Section 2.3.5](#2.3.5-Automated-Parameter-Identification).

### 2.3.2 Distribution

Various values for the fraction unbound of itraconazole have been reported in literature, ranging from 0.2 to 3.6% (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)). For this model, the final value was optimized within this range to best match observed clinical data (see [Section 2.3.5](#2.3.5-Automated-Parameter-Identification)). For the metabolites, the measured values reported by Riccardi *et al.* ([Riccardi 2015](#5-References)) were incorporated into the model. It was assumed that the major binding partner is albumin.

No pK<sub>a</sub> were reported for the thre metabolites. Here, it was assumed that the metabolites are similar to the parent drug and the reported basic pK<sub>a</sub> value of 3.7 was set (see also [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data))

An important parameter influencing the resulting volume of distribution is lipophilicty. The reported experimental or predicted logP values served asstarting values for the four compounds. Finally, the model parameters `Lipophilicity` were optimized to match best clinical data (see also [Section 2.3.5](#2.3.5-Automated-Parameter-Identification)).

After testing the available organ-plasma partition coefficient and cell permeability calculation methods built in PK-Sim, observed clinical data was best described by choosing the partition coefficient calculation by `Rodgers and Rowland` and cellular permeability calculation by `PK-Sim Standard ` for itraconazole and its metabolites.

### 2.3.3 Metabolism and Elimination

Two sequential metabolic pathway via CYP3A4 were implement into the model via Michaelis-Menten kinetics for all four compounds. *In vitro* determined unbound K<sub>m</sub> values ([Isoherranen 2004](#5-References)) served as starting values (if available) . Respective k<sub>cat</sub> values were optimized to best match clinical data (see also [Section 2.3.5](#2.3.5-Automated-Parameter-Identification)).

Additionally, for all four compounds a renal clearance (assumed to be driven by glomerular filtration) was implemented.

### 2.3.4 DDI Parameters

#### CYP3A4 inhibition
*In vitro* determined unbound K<sub>i</sub> values for itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole ([Isoherranen 2004](#5-References)) served directly as model input (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)).

*In vitro* determined unbound IC<sub>50</sub> values for keto-itraconazole and N-desalkyl-itraconazol ([Isoherranen 2004](#5-References)) were converted to K<sub>i</sub>  values via Cheng-Prusoff equation ([Chen 1973](#5-References)) with a substrate (*midazolam*) concentration of 1 µmol/L and an assumed substrate (*midazolam*) K<sub>m</sub> value of 2.73 µmol/L (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)).

#### P-gp inhibition
An *in vitro* determined K<sub>i</sub> values for itraconazole ([Shityakov 2014](#5-References)) served directly as model input (see [Section 2.2.1](#2.2.1-In-vitro-and-physico-chemical-data)).
